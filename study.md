## Creating a Hash in Ruby

Create a hash named `dale` in Ruby with the following key-value pairs.  The keys
should be symbols.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| family_name | 'gribble' |
| given-name | 'dale' |
| occupation | 'exterminator' |

```ruby
dale = Hash.new
dale[:family_name] = "gribble"
dale[:given_name] = "dale"
dale[:occupation] = "exterminator"
```

## Adding Hash Keys in Ruby
Add a key named `middle name` to `dale` with the string "Alvin" as the value.
Add another key, `hobbies`, to `dale` with an array as the value. The array
should contain two strings, "drinking beer" and "conspiracy theories".  The keys
should be symbols.

```ruby
dale[:middle_name] = "Alvin"
dale[:hobbies] = ["drinking beer", "conspiracy theories"]
```

## Removing Hash Keys in Ruby

Remove the `middle name` key from `dale`.

```ruby
dale.delete(:'middle name')

This did not delete the key.  It returned nil, I checked the hash and
[:middle_name] is still in there...
```

## Modifying Hash Values in Ruby

Modify `dale` so that the value of the key `family_name` is "Gribble" and the
value of the key `given-name` is "Dale".

```ruby
dale[:family_name] = "Gribble"
dale[:given_name] = "Dale"
```

## Ruby Hash Methods

Using Ruby's Hash methods, set a variable named `dale_keys` to `dale`'s keys.
Additionally, set a variable named `dale_values` to `dale`'s values.'

```ruby
dale_keys = dale.keys
dale_values = dale.values
```

## Accessing Hash Properties and Values

Using Hash methods and string interpolation in Ruby, create a string using
`dale` that equals "My name is Dale Gribble and I'm an exterminator that enjoys
conspiracy theories.".

```ruby
"My name is #{dale[:given_name]} #{dale[:family_name]} and I'm an #{dale[:occupation]} that enjoys #{dale[:hobbies][1]}."
```

## Creating a Dictionary in JavaScript

Create a dictionary named `hank` in JavaScript with the following key-value
pairs.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| family_name | 'hill' |
| given-name | 'hank' |
| occupation | 'propane and propane accessories salesman' |

```javascript
const hank = {
  family_name: "hill",
  'given-name': "hank",
  occupation: "propane and propane accessories salesman"
}
```

## Adding Dictionary Properties in JavaScript

Add a property named `middle name` to `hank` with the string "Rutherford" as the
value.  Add another property, `hobbies`, to `hank` with an array as the value.
The array should contain two strings, "drinking beer" and "propane and propane
accessories".

```javascript
hank['middle name'] = "Rutherford"
hank['hobbies'] = ["drinking beer", "propane and propane accessories"]
```

## Removing Dictionary Properties in JavaScript

Remove the `middle name` property from `hank`.

```javascript
delete hank['middle name']
```

## Modifying Dictionary Values in JavaScript

Modify `hank` so that the value of the key `family_name` is "Hill" and the value
of the key `given-name` is "Hank".

```javascript
hank['family_name'] = "Hill"
hank['given-name'] = "Hank"
```

## JavaScript Dictionary Methods

Using JavaScript's Array methods, set a variable named `hankKeys` to `hank`'s
keys.  Additionally, set a variable named `hankValues` to `hanks`'s values.'

```javascript
const hankKeys = Object.keys(hank)
const hankValues = Object.values(hank)
```

## Accessing Dictionary Properties and Values

Using dictionary methods and template literals in JavaScript, create a string
using `hank` that equals "My name is Hank Hill and I'm a propane and propane
accesories salesman that enjoys drinking beer.".

```javascript
const string = `My name is ${hank['given-name']} ${hank.family_name} and I'm a ${hank.occupation} that enjoys ${hank.hobbies[0]}.`;

```
