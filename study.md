## Creating a Hash in Ruby

Create a hash named `dale` in Ruby with the following key-value pairs.  The keys
should be symbols.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| family_name | 'gribble' |
| given-name | 'dale' |
| occupation | 'exterminator' |

```ruby
# your answer here
```

## Adding Hash Keys in Ruby
Add a key named `middle name` to `dale` with the string "Alvin" as the value.
Add another key, `hobbies`, to `dale` with an array as the value. The array
should contain two strings, "drinking beer" and "conspiracy theories".  The keys
should be symbols.

```ruby
#your answer here
```

## Removing Hash Keys in Ruby

Remove the `middle name` key from `dale`.

```ruby
# your answer here
```

## Modifying Hash Values in Ruby

Modify `dale` so that the value of the key `family_name` is "Gribble" and the
value of the key `given-name` is "Dale".

```ruby
# your answer here
```

## Ruby Hash Methods

Using Ruby's Hash methods, set a variable named `dale_keys` to `dale`'s keys.
Additionally, set a variable named `dale_values` to `dale`'s values.'

```ruby
# your answer here
```

## Accessing Hash Properties and Values

Using Hash methods and string interpolation in Ruby, create a string using
`dale` that equals "My name is Dale Gribble and I'm an exterminator that enjoys
conspiracy theories.".

```ruby

```

## Creating a Dictionary in JavaScript

Create a dictionary named `hank` in JavaScript with the following key-value
pairs.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| family_name | 'hill' |
| given-name | 'hank' |
| occupation | 'propane and propane accessories salesman' |

```javascript
// your answer here
```

## Adding Dictionary Properties in JavaScript

Add a property named `middle name` to `hank` with the string "Rutherford" as the
value.  Add another property, `hobbies`, to `hank` with an array as the value.
The array should contain two strings, "drinking beer" and "propane and propane
accessories".

```javascript
// your answer here
```

## Removing Dictionary Properties in JavaScript

Remove the `middle name` property from `hank`.

```javascript
// your answer here
```

## Modifying Dictionary Values in JavaScript

Modify `hank` so that the value of the key `family_name` is "Hill" and the value
of the key `given-name` is "Hank".

```javascript
// your answer here
```

## JavaScript Dictionary Methods

Using JavaScripts's array methods, set a variable named `hankKeys` to `hank`'s
keys.  Additionally, set a variable named `hankValues` to `hanks`'s values.'

```javascript
// your answer here
```

## Accessing Dictionary Properties and Values

Using dictionary methods and template strings in JavaScript, create a string
using `hank` that equals "My name is Hank Hill and I'm a propane and propane
accesories salesman that enjoys drinking beer.".

```javascript
// your answer here
```
